# ADC
Citrix ADC powershell module

After finding this module from https://github.com/devblackops/NetScaler I found out that it was missing options to query, add and remove VPX instances on a SDX. Because I needed this for a project, I've created this PS module.

The script is not documented yet, but its usable.
